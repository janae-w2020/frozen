<h1>Pro and Con of Disney's Frozen 2</h1>
<h3>After the world patiently waits for six long years, Disney’s blockbuster animation Frozen is back with its sequel this November. But, of course, like any other big films there are always the pros and cons, and Frozen 2 is not without them, curious?</h3>
<h2>PRO:</h2>
<h3>Sisterly Love</h3>

<h3>In Frozen 2, we see the two sisters (Elsa and Anna) embark on a quest to learn more about their past and save their kingdom from magical danger. While self-acceptance is the main theme in the first film, the second dwells more on sisterly-love. Anna got the better spotlight in the film, she has grown from the love-craze girl to a mature adult who understands the danger of her sister’s self-destruct personality.</h3>
<h2>CON:</h2>
<h3>Okay Music</h3>

<h3>I think we all can agree that Frozen 2 doesn’t have the same quip and catchy tunes as the first one. There are still some wonderful songs that I am currently listening on repeat (“All is Found”, “Some Things Never Change”, “When I am Older” & “Lost in the Woods”), but the big, promising ballads like “Into The Unknown”, “The Next Right Thing” and “Show Yourself” sounded like a recycle version of “Let It Go”</h3>
